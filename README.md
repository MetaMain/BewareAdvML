Code corresponding to the paper, "Beware the Black-Box: on the Robustness of Recent Defenses to Adversarial Examples":https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10876

We provide code the adaptive black-box attack and pure black-box attack in TensorFlow. We currently do not give pre-trained defense models. All code was originally tested with Python 3.5, TensorFlow version 1.17 and CleverHans 3.0.
