# Code Description

Code corresponding to the paper, "Beware the Black-Box: on the Robustness of Recent Defenses to Adversarial Examples":https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10876

For this code we provide the classes for the defenses, the adaptive black-box attack and pure black-box attack. At the current time we do not give the pre-trained defense models. All code was originally tested with TensorFlow version 1.17 and CleverHans 3.0.
